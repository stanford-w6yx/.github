# Visiting our facilities

We have two club facilities:

Site 530 (aka The Shack) is our main facility located in The Dish trail area. It's home to our largest antenna arrays for HF, VHF, UHF, and microwave communications. Highlights include the satellite/"moon bounce" communications dish, Reverse Beacon Network node, Meshtastic/AREDN mesh network nodes, two 60ft antenna towers, and occasionally spooked turkeys and deer.

Packard 302 is a room in the Packard Electrical Engineering building on Stanford’s main campus with access to software defined radios, soldering & electronics test tools, and a few roof antennas. It’s a small space, but it’s filled with good stuff and convenient for students to access!

# Getting your ham radio license

No prior experience with ham radio is required to join our club and participate in our club activities, however if you wish to transmit ham radio communications on your own (ie. without the supervision of an FCC-licensed control operator), you will need to get your own ham radio license from the FCC. You can get a license by passing a multiple choice exam while supervised by a certified proctor. The pool of exam questions are all publicly listed on the ARRL website, so when you take the exam, you will simply see a subset of questions drawn from the pool. 

There are 3 license levels for ham radio in the United States (ordered from beginner to advanced):

1. Technician
2. General
3. Amateur Extra

It typically costs $35 to register for an exam at any level. Each level has a more difficult exam than the level before it. You can continue onto the exam for the next level in the same sitting so long as you passed the previous exam, so if you are feeling ambitious, you can pass Technician+General+Extra in a single sitting. 

Prof. John Pauly typically teaches an unofficial (not for credit) seminar course each year which will teach you everything you need to know to take the Technician exam.

For the General exam, John Fore and Pete Mahowald have recorded a video tutorial series which reviews all of the General exam questions. See:
